### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the css grid in the post customized way possible. For the
html code, div was the main element used, and it was the foundation of of this
project.


### Continued development

Areas that require the use of flexboxes, more grid, and div, most modern websites are made up of
these, bo i would love to become conversant with areas such as these.
